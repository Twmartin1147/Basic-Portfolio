			Hello! My name is Tanner Martin. I was born in Texas, but lived in Canada for my Junior High and High School life, so I consider my self Canadian :). None of you know this, but I have an amazing little girl named Olivia!She will turn one on October 5th. I am going to teach her to be a gamer, programmer, and just generally awesome, though she already has the awesome part covered.</p>

			I am a nerd of sorts, I collect video game memorabilia, figures of various genres, i computer game, and build my own PCs. My most played game at the moment would either be Diablo 3, or PuBG (Player Unknown Battlegrounds). I just started playing a new game called Depth, if I were to describe it, you would probably think it is lame; So i suggest you try it out for yourself. Recently I have had to startselling my figures, so my collection isn't what it used to be, but here is an old picutre for reference.. (Still not complete collection)

			I love to travel! My goal is to live on every continent for at least 2 years by the time I pass away. I lived in Greece for three months, so Europe has been partailly completed! Even though I was born in the US, I lived in Canada for my JuniorHigh and High School careers. If you would like to contact me, drop me a message <a href="contact.html">Here!</a>
